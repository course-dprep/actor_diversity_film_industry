1.  **The project**

*Project description and research motivation*

Diversity in the entertainment industry has been a topic of interest in
recent years. Since, many discussions arise from diversity topics. On
the one hand, ethnic minorities may feel underrepresented in the
entertainment industry. On the other hand, people may claim diversity is
being forced when people of color enter settings previously deemed
"white" in famous historical depictions. Essentially, the entertainment
sector serves as a type of mirror for our culture. People typically
follow or are influenced by what they see daily. People probably watch
entertainment the most, therefore diversity and representation are
especially important there. The ability for viewers to recognize
themselves and their experiences on screen fosters a sense of connection
and understanding, which is why representation is important. Analysis of
whether and how diversity has changed throughout the years within the
entertainment sector is therefore quite intriguing.
